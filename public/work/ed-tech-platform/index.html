	/> <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>At Mentor Match, we wanted to revolutionize learning for students by providing them with quick and accessible help anytime they need it. The team had an ingenious idea - ask students to send a picture of the question they were having trouble with, and send that picture to hundreds of college students who would be paid per question they answered. Once they had a willing tutor ready to get on a call, they would connect the student and tutor over video call and voila! Problem solved.</p>
<p>I was tasked with automating as much of this process as possible. The goal was to be able to scale to tens of thousands of students in 2-3 months.</p>
<h2 id="the-foundation">The Foundation</h2>
<p>Not just our user base, but over 500 million Indians use WhatsApp. So it was a no-brainer to build our platform on WhatsApp to reach as many students as possible. But we didn&rsquo;t know if our complex flow would be supported. I first experimented with ready-made solutions like <a href="https://aisensy.com">AISensy</a>, but they failed to fulfil our needs. I concluded that we must use a WhatsApp Business Service Provider to provide me with an API and run our backend that will handle the process.</p>
<p>I scoured Github for any packages that could help me and was delighted to discover <a href="https://github.com/dotX12/waio">waio</a>. It&rsquo;s a python package which wrapped <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/">Gupshup.io&rsquo;s</a> WhatsApp API and made it convenient to maintain the kind of control we needed. Thus the tech decisions of a python backend and Gushup&rsquo;s service were obvious. I found modern python with asyncio, aiohttp and pydantic type hints pleasant to work with, but in the end, I would rather have used a compiled language like Go or Rust because we ended up facing runtime bugs with python that were tricky to track down and caused a lot of pain as more and more things break.</p>
<p>For the database, I knew we needed SQL since I had worked out the kinds of entities and relations we would require. I picked PostgreSQL, but MySQL or SQlite would&rsquo;ve been fine too. <a href="https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/">SQLModel</a> was my ORM of choice since it had nice docs and was built by the author of FastAPI.</p>
<p>And finally, since we can&rsquo;t tap into WhatsApp&rsquo;s in-built video calling feature, we had to build our own. So I spun up a React app with Vite and tried the ready-made templates from providers like <a href="https://videosdk.live/">VideoSDK</a>, <a href="https://www.100ms.live/">100ms</a> and <a href="https://www.agora.io/en/">Agora</a>. WebRTC is a whole beast of its own, and this journey taught me a lot about browser APIs, users and just how painful Safari can be.</p>
<h2 id="video-calling">Video Calling</h2>
<p>Out of the three providers we tried, I would use VideoSDK and 100ms again. Agora&rsquo;s SDK is a pain to work with not to mention that they are also the most expensive option. The call quality is comparable between the three and would depend more on the user&rsquo;s internet bandwidth.</p>
<p>Getting the video call to work consistently on a vast range of phones (everything from Redmi to iPhone) required way more effort than I could&rsquo;ve imagined.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dear Samsung, I have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing with your mobile browser, but it sucks, sorry.</li>
<li>Dear Apple, please fix this <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230902">webkit bug</a></li>
<li>Dear Users, we can&rsquo;t help you if all you tell us is that &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, the last one can be fixed quite easily, it&rsquo;s just infuriating when it happens. I asked our customer support team to retrieve answers to a canned set of debugging questions from anyone who reported an issue.</p>
<p>The rest of the React app is quite simple. It just sends out a bunch of API calls to our server on various events (call start, end, etc) so that we can track them.</p>
<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
<p>A lot of challenges I faced were related to being a funded startup looking to grow big and grow fast. I had to resist the urge to try experimental tech, onboard new hires and get them familiar with the codebase, document evolving functionality and code, and track and report progress.</p>
<p>Runtime bugs are the worst. I <code>grep</code> &rsquo;ed through thousands of lines of system logs to find issues caused by python workers hanging and timing out.</p>
<p>Since I was reliant on waio, I ended up contributing to the open-source repository when I needed features it didn&rsquo;t already provide. I joined a telegram group with the author, and we discussed how the feature I needed should be added and we had the <a href="https://github.com/dotX12/waio/pull/7">pull request</a> merged within a week of starting our conversation.</p>
<p>I am grateful to <a href="https://appsmith.com">Appsmith</a> for providing an incredibly powerful low-code builder. It completely changed my opinion on this kind of tool. I was able to quickly get a dashboard up and running for everyone else on the team to access.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Two months after I was handed this task, we were able to onboard a thousand students and a few hundred tutors onto the new platform.</p>
<p>And within a month from then, we had 30,000 students and 1,000 tutors with thousands of sessions a day.</p>
<p>The entire team did a great job, and I am proud of what we were able to accomplish in a short period of time.</p>
