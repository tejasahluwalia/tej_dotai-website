Built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind, the website aimed to create an immersive and engaging experience for the viewers while remaining quick to load. This involved a lot of experimentation realted to lazy loading images and optimizing it for viewing 800+ images of different sizes.
An instance of Cockpit CMS was setup and configured to enable others to upload and manage submitted images.</description></item><item><title>Canceled Or Not?</title><link>https://tej.ai/project/canceled-or-not/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tej.ai/project/canceled-or-not/</guid><description>A fun website built using Remix.run and SQlite3 where people can vote on how cancelled someone/something should be.
I liked some of the principles behind Remix, espcially the router and data-fetching patterns. Looking forward to the new Next.js Layout RFC to implement something similar.</description></item></channel></rss>
