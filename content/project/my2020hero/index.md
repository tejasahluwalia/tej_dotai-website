An online exhibition organised by CPB Foundation and CII in collaboration with Google showcasing heroes in our everyday lives.

Built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind, the website aimed to create an immersive and engaging experience for the viewers while remaining quick to load. This involved a lot of experimentation realted to lazy loading images and optimizing it for viewing 800+ images of different sizes.

An instance of Cockpit CMS was setup and configured to enable others to upload and manage submitted images.
